### Color Scheme

‚óè In our initial design phase, we're sticking with grayscale for that classic, user-centric feel. Still, we've added a hint of red and green to highlight essential features. Other accent colors will make their grand entrance after we've done some deep diving into UX research to really make the design pop.
