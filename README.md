# Quiz ‚ùì

‚ñ∑ Building this quiz web app is like jet fuel for my developer journey. It's a hands-on gig that's firing up my growth engine. I'm diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while crafting this interactive knowledge assessment playground. It's not just honing my problem-solving chops; it's also diving into the booming world of interactive learning. With its versatility, market appeal, and cash-making potential through ads or subscriptions, this project isn't just a personal growth path; it's a promising business venture! üí°üí∞

7. ### Approach

‚óè The approach ensures synergy with both business strategies and user expectations, emphasizing a smooth and user-focused journey

+ Organize information logically through thorough research and planning.
+ Craft the website with a focus on user experience principles.
+ Uphold straightforward navigation, intuitive design, and design coherence.
+ Guarantee that the website's content remains inclusive and non-offensive for all users.
+ Integrate a user-friendly subscription mechanism for users to join a mailing list.

### Wireframe

‚óè We've gone with Balsamiq software for those slick and responsive designs. These wireframes help us nail down the website's structure and content layout.

### Color Scheme

‚óè In our initial design phase, we're sticking with grayscale for that classic, user-centric feel. Still, we've added a hint of red and green to highlight essential features. Other accent colors will make their grand entrance after we've done some deep diving into UX research to really make the design pop.

### Typography

‚óè We're rocking a single font for that clean and unified design. But watch out ‚Äì we're eyeing some custom fonts for a bold move. We're diving into UX research, fine-tuning our goals, and teaming up. Our mission? Amp up the site's coolness and user vibes with fonts that click with our style and user tastes.

## Testing üîé

‚óè Testing at every stage of development, keeping it on point.

### Assessment

+ We've been rocking Google DevTools to check how our site dances in real-time, making sure it grooves smoothly on various devices browsers and connection speeds. Tho, no automatic test is in place right now, we've got every click and swipe covered to ensure it's all smooth sailing.

### Validation

+ We've gone through every line of code with a fine-tooth comb, and guess what? The W3C validators gave us a thumbs-up across the board.

![W3C validator check](assets/images/readme/quiz-w3c-validators.webp)

### Performance

+ I've got a thing for those numbers that light up in vibrant green.

### Bug Fixes

+ I've learned a lot by conquering those pesky logical bugs in this project. Some were straightforward, while others... not so much. I've grown to appreciate them, almost like I would a stern teacher.

It took a bit of tinkering to rearrange loadQuestion and get those questions in the right order.

```javascript
next.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (question < 5) {
        loadQuestions(question);
        document.querySelector('.quiz__footer--count').innerHTML = ++question;
    } else {
        showResults();
    }
    next.classList.add('disabled');
});
```

This one definitely added a few more gray hairs! I couldn't quite pinpoint why the event kept bubbling up to the parent.

```javascript
const options = document.querySelectorAll('.quiz__option');

options.forEach(option => {
    option.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
        event.stopPropagation();
        console.log('clicked');
    });
});
```

I ended up adding a click event to every element that houses the quiz options.

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('.quiz__option').forEach(option => {
        option.setAttribute('onclick', 'checkAnswer(this)');
        if (option.getAttribute('data-option') === questions[index].correct) {
            option.classList.add('quiz__option--correct');
        }
});
```

## Credits

‚óè Sure, I've been the sole architect handling the planning, design, and code, but I couldn't have made it happen without a few trusty allies. And to be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way. The teamwork and camaraderie in the world of programming are some of the things I value most on this journey
